Introduction
------------

In this paper, a novel deep learning architecture is proposed for change detection that targets higher-level inferencing. 
The new network architecture involves extracting features using CNN and combining filter outputs at different levels to 
localize the change. Finally, detected changes are identified using the same network, and output is an object-level change
detection with the label. 

The proposed architecture is compared with the state-of-the-art using three different modern
change detection datasets: VL-CMU-CD (Alcantarilla et al. (2018)), TSUNAMI (Sakurada and Okatani(2015)), and GSV 
(Sakurada and Okatani (2015)) datasets.
